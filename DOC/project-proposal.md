# BabiHost API-Project Proposal

## 1. Introduction

BabiHost will be an online property rental and hosting platform designed to connect travelers with hosts offering accommodations.  
The proposed API service will serve as the backend system powering web and mobile applications, enabling seamless user experiences for browsing properties, booking rooms, managing payments, and leaving reviews.  

This API will follow RESTful principles to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability.  
It will act as the single source of truth for all application data and provide endpoints for both authenticated and unauthenticated users.

- **Framework:** Laravel (PHP)  
- **Database:** SQLite (development)  
- **Development Server:** Herd  
- **Testing Tool:** Postman  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. Set up the Laravel project and configure the environment variables.  
2. Create database migrations for all entities including Users, Hosts, Properties, Rooms, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, Favorites, and Availabilities.  
3. Implement Eloquent models with proper fillable fields and relationship definitions.  
4. Develop complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each model through dedicated controllers.  
5. Add input validation to ensure data accuracy and consistency.  
6. Test all API endpoints using Postman, validating successful and error responses.  
7. Use Git for version control with clear and structured commit messages.  
8. Verify and validate relationships between entities to ensure system integrity.

## 4. Key Features

1. Provide secure user registration, login, and logout functionality.  
2. Implement a host management system allowing users to become hosts and list properties.  
3. Manage properties and rooms with full CRUD operations.  
4. Integrate booking and payment systems between users, rooms, and properties.  
5. Enable review and favorite systems for user engagement.  
6. Track availability for room scheduling.

## 5. Testing and Validation

All endpoints will be thoroughly tested in Postman. Each CRUD route will return the correct JSON responses and reflect expected database changes.  
Error handling will be implemented for invalid input, authentication failures, and relationship constraints.  
Testing will confirm the system's stability and correctness across all major entities.  

---

## 6. Version Control

Git will be used to track project progress, with frequent commits for each significant change (e.g., CRUD completion, model updates, or bug fixes).  
The repository will be hosted on GitHub for backup and collaboration purposes.  

---

## 7. Conclusion

The BabiHost project will implement a full-featured booking and hosting platform API using Laravel.  
It will demonstrate a strong understanding of backend development, database design, API structuring, and software engineering principles.  
The system will be modular, scalable, and ready for front-end integration in future stages.
